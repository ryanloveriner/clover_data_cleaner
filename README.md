This first step of the Clover to DBeaver pipeline cleans your exported csv file by removing the unnecessary pile of header rows, irrelevant columns, and extraneous whitespace.

### Find the script [HERE](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/clover_to_postgresql_automators/blob/clover_cleaner/clean_clover_report.py)

### Please note:
1) Make sure to fill in the name of the file you want to clean on line 49 and your desired output file name on line 50.

2) The file you want to clean needs to be in the same place as the Python file.

3) You'll need to run the file from your terminal.
